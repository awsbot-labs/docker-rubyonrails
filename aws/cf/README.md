# CloudFormation Templates

CloudFormation (CF) templates, are JSON files instructing Amazon on how to configure its services to create an application.

This file tells Amazon where to get the docker images for the rails web and Postgresql database, and then creates a service and endpoint in Amazon's cloud.

For more information about CloudFormation see http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/.
